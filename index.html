            <h1 class="h__position">ABOUT US</h1>
            <p class="text__position">We are a brand dedicated to digital fashion, innovating is our goal. In the current circumstances where everything that is produced leads to pollution, our objective is aimed at changing the manufacture of textile materials and replacing them with digital textures. Showing sustainability in a different way, 
            attracting attention to what we can wear can also be digital.
            </p>
            <p class="text__position">Founded this year 2022, with the support of brands with the same intention of being able to sustain and create something different. We were attracted by wanting to share our ideas so that the community can change, always positive changes. Our performance helped us to build the goal of contributing to a great cause. We are a team of few people with the intention of showing a large crowd the great changes we can bring. 
                A lot of technology and software helped us to create our garments, to continue creating in the digital field is the intention. With what is expected for the metaverse, many will start buying digital clothing.
            </p>
            <p class="text__position">If technology advances, we advance. Willing to reflect changes in our creations. More than a brand, we are collaborators and advisors in the area of digital clothing, with the aim of being able to contribute as a team with the rest of the world.</p>
